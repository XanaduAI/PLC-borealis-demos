        "\nAdvanced time-domain photonic circuits\n======================================\n\n*Authors: Fabian Laudenbach and Theodor Isacsson*\n\nIn the `beginner's demo <link-to-beginner's-demo>`_ we explained how Xanadu's\nquantum-advantage machine *Borealis* can be programmed in a fairly\nstraightforward way, using some convenience functions that helped us make our\nuser-defined circuit compatible with the hardware. In this advanced tutorial, we\nwill again define and submit an instance of Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS), but\nthis time we will carry out the steps more manually. This allows us to\nunderstand better the subtleties of time-domain programs and exercise more\ncontrol over the quantum circuit we create.\n\nLet's have a look at the schematic below. It looks very much like the one shown\nin the beginner's demo, only it's slightly more accurate as we have added two\nmore details:\n\n- There is now a phase gate located in each of the three delay lines.\n- After the three cascaded loops, the one spatial mode branches out into a\n  binary tree of 16 spatial modes, each one probed by its own photon-number\n  resolving detector.\n\n![](/tutorials/images/borealis_schematic_advanced.png)\n\n   :width: 100%\n   :align: center\n\nThis advanced tutorial will direct more focus on these aspects and help us to\nget a more comprehensive understanding of *Borealis*.\n"

Although these gate sequences are of length 216\n(the number of squeezed-light modes in our GBS instance) the actual\ntime-domain program needs to be longer than that.

We also imposed\nthat the first mode should be completely coupled into the second loop as well,\nwhich means it will arrive at the third loop no earlier 7 time bins after the\nprogram has started (1 + 6 time bins delay).

This is why the three loop offsets ``\"loop_phases\"``\nare part of the device certificate. Even though we have no direct influence on\nthem, we need to deal with them in order to obtain a correct representation of\nthe circuit that is applied. This can be done in two different ways:\n\n-  We can stay agnostic about the static offsets and use our phase modulators\n   to actively compensate for them in the background. This is done\n   automatically when the loop offsets do not occur in the ``TDMProgram``\n   submitted to the hardware.

In this case,\n   no hidden compensation takes place and the modulators apply exactly the\n   phases defined by the user.\n\nWhile in the beginner's demo we went for the first option, we will go with the\nsecond option here.

        "Submit to realistic simulation <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n\nNow, let us switch to a local simulation. In order to make it realistic, we\nwant to take optical loss into account. In the beginner's demo, realistic loss\nwas added by the compiler in the backend. Here, we want to insert the various\nloss components manually into our circuit. The daily calibration routine run\non *Borealis* decomposes the total loss suffered by our pulses into three\ncategories:\n\n- ``eta_glob``: The total loss experienced by the different modes depends on\n  which loops they have travelled through and on which detector they ended up\n  in. So it will be highly inhomogeneous within the 216 computational modes.\n  ``eta_glob``, on the other hand, describes their *common* efficiency. It is\n  experienced by a mode that bypasses all three loops and ends up in our most\n  efficient detector. In other words ``1 - eta_glob`` is the minimal loss that\n  every mode will suffer. On top of that, most modes will suffer additional\n  loss imposed by the loops and a less efficient detector.\n- ``eta_loop``: This is simply a list containing the respective efficiencies\n  of the three loop.\n- ``eta_ch_rel``: In the experiment, two consecutive pulses are only 167 ns\n  apart which exceeds the rate that one single photon-number resolving (PNR)\n  detector can handle. So although our batches of 216 squeezed-light modes\n  travel towards the detection module in one single fibre, they need to be\n  demultiplexed into 16 spatial modes, each one of them probed by its own PNR\n  detector. (You can find a schematic of our demultiplexing-and-detection\n  module illustrated in the top figure of this tutorial.) Now, instead of one\n  PNR operating at 6 MHz, we have 16 PNRs operating at 6/16 MHz. The\n  demultiplexing pattern is repetitive, meaning that detector $i$ will\n  detect all temporal modes whose index satisfies $i + 16n$ where\n  $n$ is an integer. Since the 16 spatial modes and their respective\n  detectors do not share the exact same efficiency, ``eta_ch_rel`` keeps track\n  of the loss suffered by each one of our modes individually.\n\n All of these loss components can be obtained from the ``device`` object.\n\n"

        "From here you can use the methods described in the beginner's demo to compare\nyour experimental results to the ones obtained by simulation.\n\nNote that in the above ``eng_sim.run()`` call we added the flag\n``space_unroll=True``. This feature was already used and very briefly\nexplained in the beginner's demo. Here is what this feature is about: The\ncircuit above will be rolled-up, using symbolic placeholder variables for the\ngate parameters. The circuit must be unrolled with each mode only being\nmeasured once, a process we've deciced to call space-unrolling.\n\nSpace-unrolling might seem slightly confusing, but it's actually fairly\nstraight-forward. Instead of having several modes going through the same path,\nwe interpret the TDM loop interactions as spatially separate. This way, each\nmeasurement is made on a different spatial mode, as can be seen in the\nright-hand side of the image below.\n\nThe left-handside depicts how an actual single loop TDM circuit would work,\nwhile the right-hand side is how Strawberry Fields simulates it. Since each\nmode can only be measured once (i.e., modes cannot be reused when using Fock\nmeasurements, opposite to the TD2 case, which uses homodyne measurements), the\ncircuit needs to be unrolled. To get an understanding for how this\nspace-unrolling works, try to follow the interactions happening in the\nleft-hand side single-loop setup, and try to spot them in the right-hand side\ncircuit diagram. They are in practice equal!\n\n\n"

        "Calculating the transfer matrix\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe circuit above can be described as a combination of initial state\npreparation, followed by an interferometer over the 216 modes used in the\ncircuit. This interferometer setup can be described by a so-called transfer\nmatrix. It describes the quantum circuit applied to any initial state. In the\nabsence of loss, the transfer matrix is be equivalent to the unitary. By\nhaving access to the tranfer matrix it's possible to recreate the same circuit\nusing different initial states. Instead of starting with a squeezed state, as\nwe did above, we could e.g. apply the transfer matrix to a coherent state or\nGKP states.\n\nThere is a way to quickly calculate the transfer matrix of a circuit \u2014 as\nlong as it only contains beamsplitters, rotation gates and loss channels\n\u2014 without having to execute it. This is done by using the \"passive\"\ncompiler to compile the circuit into a single transfer gate. We thus\nremove the squeezing from the circuit and simply compile the program\nusing the \"passive\" compiler, extracting the parameter from the\nrestulting ``PassiveGate``.\n\n"

        "Conclusion\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis tutorial covered how to submit jobs to our temporal-division multiplexing\ndevice, the *Borealis*. It's rather exciting to be able to demonstrate the\nconcept of quantum-computational advantage by examples running on actual\nhardware. As you now have seen, there are quite a few details to keep track\nof, but, as long as the circuit follows the correct layout, and the parameters\nare correctly declared, anyone with Xanadu cloud access can submit jobs to be\nexcecuted on the Borealis hardware, and get back samples that would be difficult, if\nnot outright impossible, to retrieve using a local simulator.\n\nWe hope that you've enjoyed this demonstration, and that you're as excited as\nwe are about the possibilities. If you wish to dig deeper into the science\nbehind all of this, we recommend you to read our paper [[#advantage2021]_].\n\n\n"
